		<h1>Migrant Growth</h1>
		<p>The unauthorized foreign migrants came mostly from Muslim-majority countries of the regions of Western Asia (Middle East), South Asia, Africa (North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa),[13][14] and Western Balkans.[15] By religious affiliation, the overwhelming majority of entrants were Muslim (including Sunni Muslims, but also non-Sunni minorities), with a small component of non-Muslim minorities (including Yazidis, Assyrians, Mandeans, etc.). According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the top three nationalities of entrants of the over one million Mediterranean Sea arrivals between January 2015 and March 2016 were Syrian (46.7%), Afghan (20.9%) and Iraqi (9.4%),[16] all overwhelmingly Muslim entrants.</p>
