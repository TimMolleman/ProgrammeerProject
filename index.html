		<h1>Europe's Migration Crisis</h1>
		<h3>Europe's History with Forced Migration</h3> 

		<p>Europe has a long history of harbouring immigrants who, for one reason or another, have been forced to leave their country of origin. For instance, shortly before and during the Second World War, a lot of people with Jewish backgrounds fled from Germany to other European countries in fear of persecution by the then ruling Nazi party. Before and during WWII the majority of people who were fleeing to European countries to seek asylum originated from a European country themselves. After WWII however, this changed. Since WWII had pretty much wrecked the entire European continent, governments in Europe decided that something like this could never happen again.These governments decided that European integration was the answer to the extreme nationalism that had caused WWII. This led to closer collaboration between European countries on both economical and political levels. As the years progressed, more and more treaties were signed that increased collaboration between European countries even more. The European Union as we still know it today was also founded. This Union now counts 28 European countries that are working together closely on political and economical levels. </p>

		<p>Because of this increasing economical and political collaboration between countries in Europe, military conflicts between European countries have become very rare. Military conflicts between countries that are part of the European Union have never even taken place since the Union's formation. Because of this decrease in military conflict between European countries, the number of Europeans fleeing their country to seek asylum in other European countries has become increasingly lower since the ending of WWII. In contrary, the number of people looking for asylum in Europe that originate from countries outside of the European continent, has become increasingly larger
		</p>

		<h3>Reasons for Immigration to Europe</h3>
		<p>People of non-European origin might try to find asylum in Europe for a number of reasons. For example, they might flee their country for fear of being persecuted by their government because of their political views, their religious beliefs or their sexual orientation. Migrants who flee their country because of fear of persecution by their government or because of armed conflict are called political migrants or 'refugees'. These immigrants are in actual physical danger if they stay in their country of origin. There are however, also migrants who solely seek asylum in Europe because of economical reasons. They want to come to Europe because they think they can live a wealthier life there than in their country of origin. These people are so called economic immigrants. They are also called fortune-hunters sometimes, since they are not in actual physical danger in their country, but are only motivated by bettering their economical position.

		<h3>The 2015 Migration Crisis</h3>
		<p>In 2015, Europe got to deal with a large number of illegal immigrants entering the continent via a number of migratory routes. A total number of 1,822,260 people illegally crossed borders of European countries to find asylum there, or in another European country. In comparison, 2014 only saw 283,175 illegal border crossings of European countries by immigrants, and this was already a large figure compared to the preceding years. The large amount of people entering Europe illegally in 2015 has begun to put serious pressure on political relations between European countries, since they all have different views on how to distribute and harbour asylum seekers over the European continent. It has also given rise to a great increase in popularity of Populist-Nationalist political parties in a number of European countries and has played a vital role in the majority of United Kingdom citizens voting 'Yes' in the June, 2016 Brexit referendum.
		</p>

		<h3>Reasons for the Crisis</h3>
		<p>
 		For the most part, illegal immigrants entering Europe in 2015 were political immigrants - however, there was also a significant number of economic immigrants among these asylum seekers. The primary reason of the huge increase of political immigrants entering Europe in 2015 in comparison to preceding years, was the escalation of conflicts in a number of Third World Countries. For instance, the ongoing civil war in Syria has caused a huge amount of Syrians to flee their country and to seek asylum in Europe in 2015. Other countries that saw an increase in their citizens fleeing to Europe to seek asylum there included Iraq and Afghanistan; countries also plagued by ongoing armed conflict. But how do all these immigrants get to Europe?
 		</p>

 		<h3>Popular Immigration Routes</h3>
		<p>The largest amount of illegal immigrants in 2015 entered Europe by means of the <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/eastern-mediterranean-route/" target="_blank">Eastern Mediterrenean</a> migratory route. While this migratory route has always been popular among immigrants who are trying to get to find asylum in Europe, the number of immigrants using this route rose to an alarming rate in 2015. A total number of 885,386 illegal immigrants entered Europe via this route. This was 17 times more than in 2014, which was already a record year with 50,380 immigrants using this route to enter Europe. Most people who used this route were immigrants fleeing from armed conflict in Middle-Eastern countries (e.g. Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan). Many of the immigrants entering Europe via the Eastern Mediterrenean route subsequently try to get to Western Europe by means of the Western Balkan route (for more information on the Western Balkan route, click <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/western-balkan-route/" target="_blank">here</a>). While the above migratory routes are not the only two routes that are used by immigrants to illegally get to Europe, they were by far the most used migratory routes in the year 2015. For information on other migratory routes to Europe, visit <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/" target="_blank">Frontex</a>. This is the official website of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. You can click on any migratory route in the map to get more information about the route.

		<h3>Our Goal</h3>
		<p> This site is meant to give you information on (illegal) migration to Europe in the past few years. If you click on the <a href="routes.html">'Visualized Data'</a> tab above, a number of visualisations are available that will give you information on the use of migratory routes in the past few years. Besides this, the amount of asylum seekers for almost every European country is also available for the past few years.
